The following 80 column are formed - type signals (see below), type function (we used - mean and std) and direction ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions)

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ
